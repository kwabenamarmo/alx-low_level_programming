# Singly linked lists:
are an essential data structure in computer programming and are commonly used to store and organize data in a linear, sequential manner. In a singly linked list, each element is called a "node," and each node contains two components: the actual data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

# Common operations performed on singly linked lists include:
Traversing the list to access or modify data.
Adding a new node at the beginning or end of the list.
Inserting a new node at a specific position in the list.
Removing a node from the list.
Finding the length of the list.
Searching for a specific element in the list.

## Implementing singly linked lists in C involves careful memory management to avoid memory leaks and ensure proper deletion of nodes when they are no longer needed.
