# Singly linked lists:
are an essential data structure in computer programming and are commonly used to store and organize data in a linear, sequential manner. In a singly linked list, each element is called a "node," and each node contains two components: the actual data and a pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

The basic structure of a singly linked list node in C can be represented using a struct:


struct Node {
    // Data to be stored in the node
    int data; // Example: could be an integer, character, or any other data type
    
    // Pointer to the next node in the list
    struct Node* next;
};

The last node in a singly linked list points to NULL, indicating the end of the list. This is why it's called a singly linked list, as each node points to only the next node.

Here's an example of a simple singly linked list with three nodes containing integers:


Head -> [data: 10] -> [data: 20] -> [data: 30] -> NULL

In this example, "Head" refers to the first node of the list, and each node contains an integer data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

To traverse a singly linked list, you start from the "Head" node and follow the "next" pointers until you reach the last node (NULL), accessing the data in each node along the way.

Singly linked lists are dynamic data structures, meaning that nodes can be added or removed from the list during runtime. This makes them flexible and efficient for certain operations, such as inserting elements at the beginning or end of the list.

# Common operations performed on singly linked lists include:
Traversing the list to access or modify data.
Adding a new node at the beginning or end of the list.
Inserting a new node at a specific position in the list.
Removing a node from the list.
Finding the length of the list.
Searching for a specific element in the list.

## Implementing singly linked lists in C involves careful memory management to avoid memory leaks and ensure proper deletion of nodes when they are no longer needed.
