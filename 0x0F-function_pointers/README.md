### C - Function Pointers
# Introduction
This repository provides examples and explanations of function pointers in the C programming language. Function pointers are a powerful feature in C that allow us to store the address of functions and call them indirectly. This can be particularly useful in various scenarios, such as implementing callbacks, dynamic function selection, and more.

Function Pointer Basics

## This section covers the fundamentals of function pointers, including how to declare them, assign functions to them, and invoke functions through pointers.

# Passing Function Pointers as Arguments
Here, we explore how to use function pointers as arguments to other functions. This enables us to implement callbacks, where a function can call another function, the address of which is passed as an argument.

# Array of Function Pointers
Learn how to create arrays of function pointers. We demonstrate the creation of a menu system that allows the user to select different functions using an array of function pointers.

# Function Pointers and Structs
In this section, we delve into using function pointers in conjunction with structs. This technique is handy for creating extensible and flexible data structures.

# Typedefs for Function Pointers
Improve code readability by using typedefs for function pointers. This makes the code more concise and easier to understand.

# NULL Pointers and Error Handling
Explore how to handle NULL pointers when working with function pointers. Proper error handling ensures the program's stability and robustness.
